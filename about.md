Hello, my name is Kieran Denshi and I'm an autodidact software developer from Lindfield, UK. 

I am a polyglot developer, but these days I mostly write code using Ruby, Python and Javascript. 

I build applications using Sinatra, Rails and NodeJS.

I make video games with Pygame, Ruby2d and Dragon Ruby.

I am a co-founder and formerly the CTO of [Teamed](https://teamed.global).

I have previously worked as a Senior Software Engineer at [Hokodo](https://www.hokodo.co/),
[Clearscore](https://www.clearscore.com) and [Pollen](https://pollen.co/)
